# Discord Sticker Cliboard

Stickers for poor people.

Discord stickers are just links. You can copy them and paste the links for the same effect. This lets you keep a bunch of them. (warning: uses cookies, so dont clear them by accident)

To get the link of a sticker, go into inspect->sources->media.discordapp.net->stickers and find the one with the matching id. Getting the link of an emoji is even easier, just right click on it.

Also works for emojis and copypastas.

If you want to add/remove/change the default stickers, you can open a PR.
